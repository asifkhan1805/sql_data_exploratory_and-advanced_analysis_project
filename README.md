# sql_data_exploratory_and-advanced_analysis_project
This project presents an exploratory and advanced data analysis of comprehensive sales for cycling company's data using MS SQL Server.The project highlights strong SQL skills, including complex joins, window functions, aggregations, and data-driven insights.

The analysis is divided into two key parts:

A. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  1.Database Exploration – Explore the structure of the database, including the list of tables and their schemas.
  2.Dimensions Exploration – Explore the structure of dimension tables.
  3.Date Exploration – To determine the temporal boundaries of key data points and understand the range of historical data.
  4.Measures Exploration – Calculate aggregated metrics (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights.
  5.Magnitude Analysis – To quantify data and group results by specific dimensions and understanding data distribution across                             categories.
  6.Ranking Analysis – Ranking products, customers, and categories by performance

B. 📊 Advanced Analytics
  7.Change-Over-Time Trends – Monthly and yearly sales trends
  8.Cumulative Analysis – Running totals and growth tracking
  9.Performance Analysis – Evaluating top-performing segments and underperformers
  10.Part-to-Whole Proportional Analysis –  To compare performance or metrics across dimensions or time periods and evaluate                                                 differences between categories.
  11.Data Segmentation –  To group data into meaningful categories for targeted insights.
  12.Reporting – 
      a. Customers -  This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors
